            <h2>1Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I
            know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may
            accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <h2>Matthew 6:28-34</h2>
            <p>28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
            spin:
            
            29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
            
            30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he
            not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
            
            31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
            
            32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
            things.
            
            33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
            
            34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto
            the day is the evil thereof.</p>
