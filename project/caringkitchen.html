            <p>My name is Carin Gardner. I am the Carin G. of CarinG Kitchen. I run a small home baking business from my
                home. I make a wide variety of bakery products for friends and family in Henderson, NV. You can see the
                items I sell by clicking the "Products" link. I am also a student at BYU Pathway pursing a Software
                Development degree in my spare time. I am a mother of 5 mostly grown children and have been happily
                married since 1997. My husband and children are huge supporters of my baking and educational goals.</p>

            <h2>My Baking Journey</h2>

            <p>One day,I found a piece of bread that had fallen in a dark place. The bread had gotten stale, but hadn't
                molded. I thought to myself, "what am I putting in my body that even mold won't eat?" I assured my
                husband that if we bought a stand mixer I would use it to make healthier bread for our family than what
                we were buying at the store. My first loaves were definitely not beautiful, but they tasted great and I
                felt better about what we were eating. Over the course of years, I experimented with new recipes and
                worked on perfecting my method. I truly enjoyed creating a product I was proud of. I loved giving my
                bread to friends and neighbors whenever I had the time. Some of my friends told me they would buy my
                bread if I ever thought of selling it. I worried that baking for money would take the joy out baking.

            <p>My kids grew up and started college and serving missions for our church. We found ourselves needing a
                little more income. I went and got a part-time job at a bakery and then a fast-food restaurant. My
                home-baking took a break. However, after a while, I injured my foot in such a way that I could no longer
                be on my feet for multiple days in a row. I thought about my friends that had offered to pay me for my
                bread and I tested how much standing my foot could take. I realized I could bake 3-4 batches a day as
                long as I had a day between baking. Caring Kitchen was born. I started selling various breads to my
                friends and family in October of 2021.</p>
